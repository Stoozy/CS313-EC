# Problem

We have decided to store words in a tree. As such: .Notice how we do this.  For the word "to", "tea" "ted" and "ten" - they all are storedstarting from "t" and then branching out, letter by letter.  This will help us look up wordsvia their spelling (like in a dictionary).  Create an algorithm to populate such a tree andsearch it.
